# gta2-trainer-cpp

## Faeatures
Player ped controlling, Cars spawning n' fixing, Weapons giving, Vocals playing, Important info showing, Non-stop crashing ultimate GTA2 trainer with so many features, I can't list them all!!! (or i'm just too lazy nevermind) 

## Fast install
Download latest release (gta2-trainer-X.XX.zip) from the panel at your right and copy its contents to your game root folder.
Then just run (in window mode) gta-trainer.exe instead of gta.exe and you should see the trainer window under the GTA2 window.

## Playing with the code
If you want to build it on your own, there is a VS solution prepared for you so it shouldn't be a problem to compile it.

Before you'll try to compile it for the first time, you have to change some settings though
1. Change the configuration to Release x86
2. Configuration Settings > General > Output directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path
3. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Program <-- change it to the GTA2-trainer.exe path
4. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Working directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path
5. Go to the Visual Studio Command Line
6. Type cd Detours
7. Type nmake
8. Wait ...
9. Done!
