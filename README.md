# gta2-trainer-cpp

## Playing with the code
If you want to build it on your own, there is a VS solution inside so it shouldn't be a problem to compile it.

Before you'll try to compile it for the first time, you have to change some settings though
1. Change the configuration to Release x86
2. Configuration Settings > General > Output directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path
3. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Program <-- change it to the GTA2-trainer.exe path
4. Configuration Settings > Debugging > Working directory <-- change it to the GTA2 root folder path
5. Go to the Visual Studio Command Line
6. Type cd Detours
7. Type nmake
8. Wait ...
9. Done!
